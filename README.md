# Interview-prep-for-research-positions

This repo includes interview preparation materials for research positions: AI researcher, research engineer, applied scientist, etc

"Passing the interviews in big tech is 80% preparation", they say.

I tried to categorize the interview types based on my recent job hunting mid-2022; below is my categorization:

## 1. SWE Coding: two types
### 1.1 Competitive programming (Most common)
Resources to prepare: LeetCode, Interviewbit
Most helpful: https://leetcode.com/study-plan/algorithm/ 
You goal should be: Solving 2 medium problems in 40 minutes


### 1.2 Everyday Programming (Less common)
Generic questions about coding and practicies such as pythong tips, git, threading, general SWE skills, etc.

## 2. System Design:
You get one case study about a system (not ML) and you need to walk through all components. Example: Design the tinyurl system

- System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide Book by Alex Xu

## 3. ML System Design (or similarily use-case interview)
You get an ML real-world problem that you need to tackle
This goes from data preparation, preprocessing, feature selection, choosing models, evaluation, deployment, A/B testing
Example: Design youtube recommendation system

**Top Resources:**
- Educative.io: [ML system design](https://www.educative.io/courses/machine-learning-system-design)
- Chip Huyenâ€™s book: [ML Systems Design](https://huyenchip.com/machine-learning-systems-design/toc.html) / [ML interview book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/)


## 4. AI Coding:
Never clear what to expect, but always ask
Most probably it will be about code simple machine learning : Activation functions, linear regression, gradient descent, metrics (precision, recall, etc), MLP, decision trees, K-means, loss functions, etc. so, for most of these, you should know the equation, and know how to code them in python or pytorch.

## 5. DL Research interviews:
ToDo before the interview: Research the interviewers, their expertise, their google scholar publications, their linkedin, find any previous presentations for them

**To study:**
- ML basics
- Deep learning (optimizers, Conv layers, RNNs, dropout, activations, etc.)
- Computer vision, RL, NLP (depending on the position), well-known algorithms/models in each

- Basics: https://cs231n.github.io/ 
- RL: https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/ 

## 6. Research presentations: 
This can be either about your thesis or a research paper. You should expect that they will criticize it well and raise questions. You should also know the audience beforehand.

## 7. Behavioral Interview:
To prepare: 
- Study your CV well
- Prepare your answers in terms of the STAR approach (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

Below are detailed examples of the interview process in some companines:
### Meta: Research Engineer, team-specific
- 1 Screening interview: Research (computer vision)
- Virtual on-site interviews: 1) System Design, 2) AI Coding, 3) Behavioral, 4) SWE coding, 5) Research

### Meta: ML Engineer:
- 1-2 Screening interviews: SWE coding
- Virtual on-site interviews: 1) System Design, 2) ML System Design, 3) Behavioral, 4) 2 SWE coding

### Microsoft Research: Research Software Engineer 2
- 1 Screening interview: SWE
- Virtual on-site interviews: 1) ML system design + SWE coding, 2) SWE coding, 3) Behavioral, 4) 2 Research interviews
